#+TITLE: laag - Library as a Gem
#+LATEX: \pagebreak

* Overview
  
  ~laag~ is a library to support packaging libraries as Ruby Gems.

* Why does this exist?

  Ruby is portable and readily available on all significant platforms. It has
  solid tools for dependency management, versioning, and vendoring.

  ~laag~ leverages these tools to provide platform-native libraries, so that
  other Gems that need those libraries can be easier to install.

* License

  ~laag~ is available under the [[https://tldrlegal.com/license/mit-license][MIT License]]. See ~LICENSE.txt~ for the full
  text.
